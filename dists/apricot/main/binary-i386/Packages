Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (all subpackages)
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This is a dummy package which brings in all subpackages.

 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git cvsimport, cvsexportcommit, and cvsserver
 tools, which allow Git to read from and write to CVS repositories and
 offer access over CVS protocol to Git repositories.
 .
 The git cvsimport tool can incrementally import from a repository that
 is being actively developed and only requires remote access over CVS
 protocol. Unfortunately, in many situations the import leads to
 incorrect results. For reliable, one-shot imports, cvs2git from the
 cvs2svn package or parsecvs may be a better fit.

 git-daemon, as provided by the git package, is a simple server for git
 repositories, ideally suited for read-only updates, i.e. pulling from git
 repositories through the network.  This package provides a runit service
 for running git-daemon permanently.  This configuration is simpler and
 more reliable than git-daemon-sysvinit, at a cost of being less
 familiar for administrators accustomed to sysvinit.

Description: C++11/14/17 std::expected with functional-style extensions
 Single header implementation of std::expected with functional-style extensions.
 .
 std::expected is proposed as the preferred way to represent object which will
 either have an expected value, or an unexpected value giving information about
 why something failed. Unfortunately, chaining together many computations which
 may fail can be verbose, as error-checking code will be mixed in with the
 actual programming logic. This implementation provides a number of utilities to
 make coding with expected cleaner.

Description: range algorithms, views, and actions for C++14/17/20 - headers
 Range-v3 is a generic library that augments the existing standard library with
 facilities for working with ranges. A range can be loosely thought of a pair
 of iterators. This library provides a full implementation of all the standard
 algorithms with range-based overloads for convenience.
 .
 This package contains headers of the library.
