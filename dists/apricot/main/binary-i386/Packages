Description: C++11/14/17 std::expected with functional-style extensions
 Single header implementation of std::expected with functional-style extensions.
 .
 std::expected is proposed as the preferred way to represent object which will
 either have an expected value, or an unexpected value giving information about
 why something failed. Unfortunately, chaining together many computations which
 may fail can be verbose, as error-checking code will be mixed in with the
 actual programming logic. This implementation provides a number of utilities to
 make coding with expected cleaner.

Description: range algorithms, views, and actions for C++14/17/20 - headers
 Range-v3 is a generic library that augments the existing standard library with
 facilities for working with ranges. A range can be loosely thought of a pair
 of iterators. This library provides a full implementation of all the standard
 algorithms with range-based overloads for convenience.
 .
 This package contains headers of the library.
